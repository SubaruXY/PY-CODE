Basketball is a high-scoring game, and leads can be quickly erased. As a spectator, you want to know early on if the lead is unassailable at the end of the game. Sportswriter Bill James has developed an algorithm to determine if a lead is "safe."

Algorithm description: 
1) Obtain the leading score, subtract 3 points;

2) If the leading team currently has the ball, 0.5 is added; Otherwise, minus 0.5 (if the number is less than 0, it becomes 0);

3) Calculate the result after square;

4) The lead is "safe" if the result is greater than the number of seconds remaining in the current race.
Please write a program to realize the function of the above algorithm, and give the running result

<Br/>Grade =eval(input(' please enter the lead score :'))
<Br/>Time =eval(input(' Please enter the remaining time :'))
<Br/>t=grade-3
<Br/>W =input(' is the leading team in possession of the ball (Y or N) : ')
<Br/>if w == 'Y' or w == 'y':
<Br/>G = (t + 0.5) * * 2
<Br/>else:
<Br/>G = t - 0.5
<Br/>if g<=0:
<Br/>g=0
<Br/>g=g**2
<Br/>if g>time:
<Br/>Print (' Lead is' safe ')
<Br/>else:
<Br/>Print (' Lead is' unsafe ')

A has $100, A goes to the supermarket to buy three kinds of cleaning products: shampoo ($15), soap ($2), toothbrush ($5). What combination of purchases are available if A want to spend exactly $100?
<Br/>money=100
 <Br/>n=money//15
 <Br/>for i in range(n,-1,-1):
    <Br/> m=(money-i*15)//5
  <Br/>   for j in range(m,-1,-1):
    <Br/>     k=(money-i*15-j*5)//2
    <Br/>     if (money-i*15-j*5)%2==0:
       <Br/>      print('Can choose:		buy shampoo {} ，soap {} ，toothbrush {}。'.format(i,j,k))
