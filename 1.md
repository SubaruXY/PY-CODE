# PY-CODE
Basketball is a high-scoring game, and leads can be quickly erased. As a spectator, you want to know early on if the lead is unassailable at the end of the game. Sportswriter Bill James has developed an algorithm to determine if a lead is "safe."

Algorithm description: 
1) Obtain the leading score, subtract 3 points;

2) If the leading team currently has the ball, 0.5 is added; Otherwise, minus 0.5 (if the number is less than 0, it becomes 0);

3) Calculate the result after square;

4) The lead is "safe" if the result is greater than the number of seconds remaining in the current race.
Please write a program to realize the function of the above algorithm, and give the running result

<Br/>Grade =eval(input(' please enter the lead score :'))
<Br/>Time =eval(input(' Please enter the remaining time :'))
<Br/>t=grade-3
<Br/>W =input(' is the leading team in possession of the ball (Y or N) : ')
<Br/>if w == 'Y' or w == 'y':
<Br/>G = (t + 0.5) * * 2
<Br/>else:
<Br/>G = t - 0.5
<Br/>if g<=0:
<Br/>g=0
<Br/>g=g**2
<Br/>if g>time:
<Br/>Print (' Lead is' safe ')
<Br/>else:
<Br/>Print (' Lead is' unsafe ')
